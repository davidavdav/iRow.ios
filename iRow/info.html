    <h2> Quick help </h2>
    
     <h3> Ergometer tab</h3> 
    <img src="help-ergometer1.png">
     <p> The Ergometer tab shows basic statistics while rowing: speed, distance and stroke tempo.  These come in `current', `average' and `total' variants.  </p>
    <h4>Start button</h4>
    <img src="help-start-button.png">
        <p>Pressing the start button starts a track.  Total time, distance and number of strokes are reset to zero, averages start from this moment. 
    <h4>Current</h4>
     <p> Under `Current' you find the current speed and stroke frequency.  Values in this part are always updated whenever a change in position or stroke movement is detected. </p>    
     <p> The speed is expressed in <i>time</i>/500m, m/s or <i>distance</i>/h&mdash;you can tap the speed indicator to cycle to the units of your choice (you can change to imperial units in the settings).  To the right you find the current stroke frequency.  The strokes are detected by accelerations in the `length' direction of your iPhone, they are detected best if you lie the device flat in the boat.</p>

    <h4> Average </h4>
    <p> Under `Average' you find average speed and stroke frequency, measured over the period since pressing the start button.  Pressing the average speed indicator cycles the units in backward direction.
    
    <h4> Total </h4>
    <p> Under `Total' you find total time, total distance and total number of strokes, since the start button was pressed.  Beneath the total distance, in parenthesis, you find the iPhone's current positioning accuracy. 
        
    <h3> Map tab </h3>
    <img src="help-map.png">
    <p> The map show you where you are, and what your track so far is.  You can zoom/pan like in the normal Map App.  
        
    <h4> Zoom control bezel </h4>
    <p> At the bottom is a bezel with four buttons that control the zoom mode.  
        <ul>
            <li>By pressing the crosshair button, the map stays centered at the current location.
            <li>When the "track" button is pressed, the map is moved to show the current track. 
            <li>By selecting "course", the map is move to the current course, if any. 
            <li>If "none" is selected, no automatic zoom control is in effect. 
        </ul></p>
    <h4>Course mode</h4>
    <p> At the top is the <img src="help-course-unselected.png"> button.  By pressing this, you select the course mode. In this mode, you can:
        <ul>
            <li>Define the start/finish of a course to be rowed.  Press the <img src="help-UIButtonBarContactAdd.png"> button and a pin is dropped at the middle of the map.  You can precicely "aim" by inspecting the crosshair in the middle while adjusting the map position and zoom level.
            <li>Define consecutive segments of the course, by adding more pins.  The total distance of the course is shown at the bottom right in a green background. 
            <li>Move pins, by selecting them (single tap) and then drag them to adjust their position.
            <li>Remove pins, by selecting them, and pressing the <img src="PLBlueMinus.png"> button. 
            <li>Delete the current course, by pressing the "course" button and shifting it sideways.  
        </ul>
        <p>In course mode, the tracking starts automatically by passing start- and finish line.  See below. </p>
    <h3>Automatic start/stop in course mode</h3>
        <p>When course mode is selected, the ergometer starts/stops automatically when crossing start and finish lines. Course mode is active if the course button is green in the Map tab:</p>
        <img src="help-course-selected.png">
        <p>When you move outside the course on either side and select the Ergometer tab, the start button  changes to "Prepare for start".  When you press the button, it changes to "Waiting to cross the start line".  The total distance shows the distance to the start line.</p>
    <h4>Still to go...</h4>
        <p> When the start line is passed, the numbers in the display show estimations of how much time/distance / how many strokes are necessary to reach the finish. 
    <h4>Finish</h4>
    <img src="help-finish.png">
    <p>When crossing the finish line in course mode, the "finish" button is automatically pressed.  Totals now revert to total time/distance/strokes again, and the track recording is stopped. 

  <h3>Options tab</h3>
    <img src="help-options.png" width=54.5>
    <p> The options tab allows you to access the iRow database, change settings and browse though this help. 
        
    <h4>Track</h4>
        <p> A track is a record of a rowing trip or excercise.  It stores the location, time, and stroke profile information.  Additionally, you can add  information about the boat used and the people in the boat.  
            <ul>
                <li>In the "Save Current Track" menu you can name the track and location, and specify the boat and the people in it.  You can always update or change this information later.</li>
                <li>In the "Browse Tracks" menu you can select previously saved tracks, and get global statistics or view the detailed rowing speed profile. </li>
            </ul>
    <h4>Course</h4>
        <p>A course is a fixed route that can be rowed, which allows automatic start/stop of the track statistics. You can create a course form the Map tab  by dropping pins (see above).  
        <ul>
            <li>In the "Save Course" menu, you can save the course currently defined in the Map tab.  You can give it a name and specify the waterway the course is located.</li>
            <li>In the "Browse Courses" menu, you can inspect courses and load them for usage.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h4>Help</h4>
        <p>In the help section you can read this help and change some global settings of iRow. 
    
        <p> The following settings can be changed:
        <ul>
            <li>Stroke sensitivity.  The stroke detection sensitivity should be set normally at about 70%&mdash;the acceleration threshold value 0.10 should show up in the title.  If you experience spurious strokes, move the slider a little to the left, if your strokes are not detected well, move the slider a little to the right.</li>
            <li>Unit system for speed and distance.  You can choose between metric (m, km, km/h) and imperial (yd, mile, mph).</li>
            <li>Speed Units.  You can choose between <i>time</i>/500m, m/s and km/h (or mph in the case of imperial units).  Note that you can also cycle through these options from the Ergometer tab view, by tapping any of the speeds shown in the display. </li>
            <li>Track position while off. This allows for registering your track when you have turned the screen off, or when iRow is running in the background.  Normally, when a track is recorded, the auto-lock feature of the device is disabled, so that the information on the display is shown even if you don't operate the app.  If you turn the screen off manually this option might be useful, but please note that the stroke detection cannot function when another app is running in the foreground or when the screen is turned off.</li>
            <li>Auto save tracks.  With this switched on, a track is saved every time a track recording is finished.  This can be either be because the "Finish" button is tapped, or because the finish line is crossed in course more.</li>
            <li>Stroke Profile.  Turning on the experimental support for stroke profile inspection allows you to inspect the acceleration profile of the boat during the track.  This can be done from the Options tab / Browse Tracks / <i>track</i> / Inspect Track page by pressing the "switch" button.  Note that this still is experimental as we need more stroke profile data from different rowers and different boats to make the stroke alignment algorithm better.</li>
            <li>100Hz sampling.  This option causes the frequency of data acquisition from the accelerometers to be 100 Hz, which appears to be the hardware limit of the accelerometers in the iPhone.  This may result in less noisy stroke profile recording, but may also drain the batteries quicker.  Note that even with this option on, the accelerometer data is stored at 10Hz.</li>
            <li>Auto orientation.  This option alows you to position the device in any orientation.  After a couple of strokes the direction of movement should be picked up automatically.  Note that the stroke profile display still only shows the acceleration along the length-direction of the iPhone.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h4>Rowing Mates</h4>
        <p>By keeping a small database of the people you regularly row with, you can easily specify who was participating in each track you store.  This then allows for computing statistics such as total mass, available power etc.  You are one of the people in the database, but you have a separate entry.  While adding a person to the database, it is possible to choose someone from the Addressbook app in your iDevice.  

    <h4>Boats</h4>
        <p>You can also enter the boats you row in the database, and specify the name, type, weight and build date.  You can indicate which boat you used when storing a track.</p>
    <h4>Import/Export</h4>
        <p> You can import tracks, courses, rowing mates and boats from iTunes or e-mail.  If you connect the device to iTunes, select the decive, go to the "Apps" tab, scroll down to "File Sharing," and click the iRow icon. Under "Documents" you can then add files of the type "iRow" that you may receive from other users of the iRow app.  If the files are sent to you by e-mail, you can directly open these in iRow from the e-mail App.  All data base items found are shown, and you can select which ones to import in the database by tapping them.  Note that importing one or several items does not link the relations in the database, e.g., when you import your friend's track that was rowed in her boat, the "boat" entry is left blank because you may not have that boat in your database.</p>
        <p>You can export iRow database items (tracks, courses, rowing mates and boats) by tapping "Export database."  You can choose between iTunes and e-mail.  With iTunes, the data base files show up under "Documents" of your App's File Sharing proerties in iTunes.  You can also select e-mail to send the file to yourself or a rowing mate by e-mail. </p>
        <p>In the various sub-menus there are separate import/export options as well.  In "Browse Tracks" and "Browse course" you have the option to save the track or course in Google Earth's <tt>kml</tt> format.  You can export this <tt>kml</tt> by e-mail or though iTunes.</p>
        
  <h3>iCloud support</h3>
    <img src="AppleAccountSettings_icloud.png">
    <p> The database (tracks, courses, rowers and boats) is automatically synchonized with iCloud if you have activated iCloud.  When you install this app on another iDevice (e.g., an iPad) the existing iCloud database is downloaded and further kept synchronized.
