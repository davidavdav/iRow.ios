 <h1>About iRow</h1>
    
    <p> iRow is an App that tracks your speed, position and strokes during rowing.  </p>

     <p>Your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad is a device that is very sensitive to water.  You lose all warranty if it gets wet.  Please take measures to protect your device from becoming wet before you take it with you in the boat.  We are not liable in the event that anything happens to your device by using this App. </p>

     <h3> Ergometer tab</h3> 
    <img src="help-ergometer1.png">
     <p> The Ergometer tab shows basic statistics while rowing: speed, distance and stroke tempo.  These come in `current', `average' and `total' variants.  </p>
    <h4>Start button</h4>
    <img src="help-start-button.png">
        <p>Pressing the start button starts a track.  Total time, distance and number of strokes are reset to zero, averages start from this moment. 
    <h4>Current</h4>
     <p> Under `Current' you find the current speed and stroke frequency.  Values in this part are always updated whenever a change in position or stroke movement is detected. </p>    
     <p> The speed is expressed in <i>time</i>/500m, m/s or <i>distance</i>/h&mdash;you can tap the speed indicator to cycle to the units of your choice (you can change to imperial units in the system settings).  To the right you find the current stroke frequency.  The strokes are detected by accelerations in the `length' direction of your iPhone, they are detected best if you lie the device flat in the boat.</p>

    <h4> Average </h4>
    <p> Under `Average' you find average speed and stroke frequency, measured over the period since pressing the start button.  Pressing the average speed indicator cycles the units in backward direction.
    
    <h4> Total </h4>
    <p> Under `Total' you find total time, total distance and total number of strokes, since the start button was pressed.  Beneath the total distance, in parenthesis, you find the iPhone's current positioning accuracy. 
        
    <h3> Map tab </h3>
    <img src="help-map.png">
    <p> The map show you where you are, and what your track so far is.  You can zoom/pan like in the normal Map App.  
        
    <h4> Zoom control bezel </h4>
    <p> At the bottom is a bezel with four buttons that control the zoom mode.  
        <ul>
            <li>By pressing the crosshair button, the map stays centered at the current location.
            <li>When the "track" button is pressed, the map is moved to show the current track. 
            <li>By selecting "course", the map is move to the current course, if any. 
            <li>If "none" is selected, no automatic zoom control is in effect. 
        </ul></p>
    <h4>Course mode</h4>
    <p> At the top is the <img src="help-course-unselected.png"> button.  By pressing this, you select the course mode. In this mode, you can:
        <ul>
            <li>Define the start/finish of a course to be rowed.  Press the <img src="help-UIButtonBarContactAdd.png"> button and a pin is dropped at the middle of the map.  You can precicely "aim" by inspecting the crosshair in the middle while adjusting the map position and zoom level.
            <li>Define consecutive segments of the course, by adding more pins.  The total distance of the course is shown at the bottom right in a green background. 
            <li>Move pins, by selecting them (single tap) and then drag them to adjust their position.
            <li>Remove pins, by selecting them, and pressing the <img src="PLBlueMinus.png"> button. 
            <li>Delete the current course, by pressing the "course" button and shifting it sideways.  
        </ul>
        <p>In course mode, the tracking starts automatically by passing start- and finish line.  See below. </p>
    <h3>Automatic start/stop in course mode</h3>
        <p>When course mode is selected, the ergometer starts/stops automatically when crossing start and finish lines. Course mode is active if the course button is green in the Map tab:</p>
        <img src="help-course-selected.png">
        <p>When you move outside the course on either side and select the Ergometer tab, the start button  changes to "Prepare for start".  When you press the button, it changes to "Waiting to cross the start line".  The total distance shows the distance to the start line.</p>
    <h4>Still to go...</h4>
        <p> When the start line is passed, the numbers in the display show estimations of how much time/distance / how many strokes are necessary to reach the finish. 
    <h4>Finish</h4>
    <img src="help-finish.png">
    <p>When crossing the finish line in course mode, the "finish" button is automatically pressed.  Totals now revert to total time/distance/strokes again, and the track recording is stopped. 

    <h2>Settings</h2>
        <p> iRow settings are reachable through the General settings App, in the third party Apps section.  You can set the stroke detection sensitivity and the unit system for speed and distance.  The stroke detection sensitivity should be set normally in the middle.  If you experience spurious strokes, move the slider a little to the left, if your strokes are not detected well, move the slider a little to the right.
